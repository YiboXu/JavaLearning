A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles   the collective intelligence   locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users.    Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.    This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.    Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Satnam Alag&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Internet&quot; ] }</td>

On an average day, somewhere between 500,000 and 2 million coders do something in PHP. Even when you use a well-understood language like PHP, building a modern web application requires tools that decrease development time and cost while improving code quality. Frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a result.     For PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise without the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of components can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the development process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend Technologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language in which it is written. The first production release of the Zend Framework became available in July of 2007.    Zend Framework in Action is a comprehensive tutorial that shows how to use the Zend Framework to create web-based applications and web services. This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application. This book is organized around the techniques you&#39;ll use every day as a web developer \&quot;data handling, forms, authentication, and so forth. As you follow the running example, you&#39;ll learn to build interactive Ajax-driven features into your application without sacrificing nuts-and-bolts considerations like security and performance.  This book is aimed at the competent PHP developer who wants to master framework-driven web development. Zend Framework in Action goes beyond the docs but still provides quick access to the most common topics encountered in the development of web applications.  &quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Rob Allen&quot;, &quot;Nick Lo&quot;, &quot;Steven Brown&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Web Development&quot; ] }</td>

OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problem domain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.    Author Alexandre Alves guides you through major concepts, such as the definition of programming models and modularization techniques, and complements them with samples that have real applicability using industry-proved technologies, such as Spring-DM and Equinox.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Alexandre de Castro Alves&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

You definitely get your money&#39;s worth.\&quot;&quot;, &quot;longDescription&quot; : &quot;Rails is a fantastic tool for web application development, but its Ajax-driven interfaces stop short of the richness you gain with a tool like Adobe Flex. Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUD application. Together, they&#39;re an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to build next-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it&#39;s an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book, you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it \&quot;Flex Immersion.\&quot; You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.    You will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.    Flexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than are possible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Peter Armstrong&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Web Development&quot; ] }</td>

A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.    Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on. Because in software development one size does not fit all, TFS provides process customization, project management, and reporting capabilities to build solutions around your requirements.    Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a hands-on guide to Team Foundation Server 2008. Written for developers with a good handle on TFS basics, this book shows you how to solve real-life problems. It&#39;s not a repetition of Microsoft&#39;s product documentation. Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a practitioner&#39;s handbook for how to work with TFS under common constraints. This book walks you through real-life software engineering problems based on hundreds of hours of TFS experience.    You&#39;ll benefit from expert author Jamil Azher&#39;s extensive interactions with members of Microsoft&#39;s TFS team and MVPs, survey feedback from the author&#39;s blog, and interviews with organizations and user groups using TFS. Instead of just offering a high-level overview, the book provides detailed solutions for solving common   and not-so-common   problems using TFS. It discusses the strengths as well as weaknesses of TFS, and suggests appropriate problem resolution steps, workarounds, or custom solutions.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Jamil Azher&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Microsoft .NET&quot; ] }</td>

So-called \&quot;greenfield\&quot; projects often involve learning new technology and the opportunity for experimentation. Working on established software projects may seem less glamorous.    Most software developers have inherited a monolithic application where the day-to-day tasks involve maintenance, incremental improvements, or even cleaning up the mess another programmer left behind. These legacy or brownfield projects often have tightly coupled components, low cohesion, and poor separation of concerns, making them fragile and resistant to change.    Brownfield Application Development in .Net shows you how to approach legacy applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you&#39;ve learned to apply to new projects. Using an existing application as an example, this book guides you in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.    As the book proceeds, the authors introduce frameworks and tools commonly used today while still approaching the subject from a conceptual level so that you can substitute alternate tools as appropriate. This book examines the reasons why a tool is necessary, not the tool itself. Because the book is based on the authors&#39; experiences, Brownfield Application Development in .Net moves beyond the theories and shows you the techniques you need to be successful.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Kyle Baley&quot;, &quot;Donald Belcham&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Microsoft&quot; ] }</td>

Why is this open-source tool so popular  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.    The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day - they know how to make Hibernate sing.

Hibernate, the most popular Java persistence tool, provides automatic and transparent object/relational mapping so it&#39;s a snap to work with SQL databases in Java applications. Hibernate conforms to the new EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence 1.0 standards.    Java Persistence with Hibernate explores Hibernate by developing an application that ties together hundreds of individual examples. You&#39;ll immediately dig into the rich programming model of Hibernate 3.2 and Java Persistence, working through queries, fetching strategies, caching, transactions, conversations, and more. You&#39;ll also appreciate the well-illustrated discussion of best practices in database design, object/relational mapping, and optimization techniques.    In this revised edition of Manning&#39;s bestselling Hibernate in Action, authors Christian Bauer and Gavin King -- the founder of the Hibernate project -- cover Hibernate 3.2 in detail along with the EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence 1.0 standards.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Christian Bauer&quot;, &quot;Gavin King&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

From simple loops to tricky XML processing, every feature of JSTL is covered and exercised in numerous useful examples. Whether you are a novice page author or an experienced Java programmer, this book shows you easy ways to create powerful web sites.    To help readers who don&#39;t already have a JSP container run the examples in the book, there&#39;s a free companion download here.

There   s no need to change existing database schemas   iBATIS is tolerant of legacy databases (even badly designed ones).    iBATIS in Action is a comprehensive tutorial on the framework and an introduction to the iBATIS philosophy. Clinton Begin and coauthors lead you through the core features, including configuration, statements, and transactions. Because you   ll need more than the basics, it explores sophisticated topics like Dynamic SQL and data layer abstraction. You   ll also learn a useful skill: how to extend iBATIS itself.

All software developers and managers seeking to develop \&quot;hard\&quot; software will benefit from these ideas.    There are six essential tasks necessary for a good design:    User (run-time) requirements  Development sponsor (build-time) requirements  Domain information  Behavior identification and allocation  Behavior description  Software system architecture  Designing Hard Software goes beyond the standard software development methodologies such as those by Booch, Rumbaugh, Yourdon, and others, by providing techniques for a complete system architecture as well as explicit measures of the goodness of design.

Anyone who has looked at the demos and gotten a taste of what Silverlight can do knows that Silverlight represents an entirely new level of rich web interface technology for Microsoft developers. With Silverlight 2, developers can use JavaScript, VB, C#, Python, and Ruby to build user-friendly, interactive, and visually-dazzling web applications that work in most major browsers.    Silverlight 2 in Action is the first book to cover Silverlight 2, a far more robust implementation of Silverlight than the current 1 release that supports only JavaScript. The much-anticipated 2 release adds powerful new features along with the ability to code in multiple languages and integrate your work with Visual Studio and the new Expression suite of tools. This book delivers real-world examples and in-depth walkthroughs to help you confidently enhance your web applications using Silverlight 2.    Silverlight 2 in Action devotes extensive coverage to flexible layout components, the extensible control model, the communication framework, and the data-binding features   all cornerstones of software development. Author and Microsoft MVP Chad Campbell also describes rich media and vivid graphical and animation features. The final chapters include a variety of Silverlight deployment scenarios.    In addition to the fundamentals of Silverlight, you&#39;ll be introduced to architectural components such as the Silverlight object model. The book addresses the developer/designer collaboration model Silverlight enables, showing the developer how to include the designer effectively in the project workflow. This model is illustrated throughout the examples.    For ongoing reader support, the author will maintain a dedicated book-support website providing up-to-the-minute working examples, complete with source code, all in Silverlight.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Chad A.

SQL Server 2008 is a massive and mature product with a very large feature set. As a SQL Server administrator, you must be equipped to handle myriad day-to-day tasks to keep your database healthy, and you must also be prepared to act quickly when something unexpected happens.    SQL Server 2008 Administration in Action offers over 100 DBA-tested, high-value, best practices that will help you tame the beast and keep it under control. Unlike the many comprehensive SQL Server reference tomes out there that attempt to cover the whole SQL Server feature set, this book drills down on the techniques, procedures, and practices that help you keep your database running like clockwork.    SQL Server 2008 Administration in Action focuses the production DBA, digging deep into the various tasks specific to that role. Expert author Rod Colledge--check him out at sqlCrunch.com--teaches you best practices that cover the lifecycle of a SQL Server system, including infrastructure design, installation, and operational maintenance. And while many of these techniques will work in any recent version of SQL Server, you&#39;ll find full coverage of emerging SQL Server 2008 best practices.    Each technique is presented in a task-driven style, and in the order of the typical life cycle of a SQL Server system. This allows you to easily open the book at the appropriate page and focus on what you need to know for each specific situation.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Rod Colledge&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Microsoft&quot; ] }</td>

Shobana Jayaraman, Digital Infrastructure Analyst, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Library, The Tech Static&quot;, &quot;longDescription&quot; : &quot;Seam is an exciting new application framework based on the Java EE platform that you can use to build rich, web-based business applications. Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, scalability, and developer choice.    Seam in Action offers a practical and in-depth look at Seam from outside the walls of RedHat/JBoss. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities in the Java EE architecture. It discusses the shortcomings of JSF, the challenges of using Java persistence in the web environment, and other common development roadblocks, then shows how Seam makes these problems just melt away. In covering Seam, the author doesn&#39;t just ask you to sprinkle annotations on your code and expect that you understand how it works. Instead, the author lays down the facts, shows you the steps, reveals the logic, and diagrams the flow, so that by the end of the book, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of Seam, but will also come away ready to teach the material to others.    All too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand. Seam in Action dives deep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these non-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5 annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.    To start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations and uses an inversion of control technical known as bijection supplemented by a liberal use of the Unified Expression Language (EL) to establish the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. You also witness how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), rule-based security, Ajax remoting, PDF generation, Spring integration, and more.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Dan Allen&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

This is accomplished by breaking individual units of functionality into services that can then be exposed through open protocols and standards.    Until recently, many of the software technologies used for developing SOA-based solutions were limited to expensive, commercial offerings. However, that has now changed, and a compelling open source SOA platform can be implemented exclusively with open source products. This book identifies a suite of open source products that can be used for a building SOA environment, and describes how they can be integrated by practitioners. It includes a hands-on introduction to the products selected; a multitude of source code examples; and implementation through real-life case studies.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Jeff Davis&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

With .NET you can develop stable and robust multithreaded applications with minimal effort. .NET Multithreading teaches the basics in an understandable and practical way. It then focuses on .NET&#39;s mechanisms for multithreading and shows how easy it can be to develop applications with them. The book covers several design approaches such as one-thread-one-class, the asynchronous design pattern, and using queues as buffers between threads. It explains best practices and how to avoid common multithreading pitfalls such as deadlock and race conditions.    This book is written for intermediate .NET developers who know C# or VB .NET, but are not assumed to have a background in multithreading.

Python and Tkinter Programming is the answer. It is designed for readers who are familiar with Python and who need to develop applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).    Python and Tkinter Programming presents the elements of typical Python and Tkinter applications in a straight-forward fashion. Sample code illustrates each element. Complete applications that go far beyond the fill-the-form class of graphical user interfaces are presented; here you will find examples of complex controls, drawn interfaces and photorealistic panels. The code can readily be used as templates for new applications. Extensions to Python (such as ODBC) are examined as well. Complete source code for all examples, along with the latest releases of required software, will be available from Manning&#39;s web site.    Tkinter is fully documented. To date, this level of documentation has not been available to Tkinter programmers, who have been required to read the code or interpret Tcl/Tk man pages to fully understand component usage.    Python and Tkinter Programming will be useful in both Windows and Unix environments, and the example code is portable between the two environments.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;John E.

But you may still be wondering exactly \&quot;What is OSGi \&quot;    Simply put, OSGi is a technology that allows you to create highly modular Java applications. It introduces a logical and physical module format, called a bundle, for explicitly structuring your application as a set of interconnected modules. OSGi lets you install, start, stop, update, or uninstall modules at execution time without taking down your entire system. In addition, OSGi defines a local service-oriented approach for creating applications out of loosely coupled components.    With the prevalence of modern component and service-based architectures, OSGi is becoming increasingly important. It meshes well with such approaches and greatly simplifies their creation and management. It&#39;s the backbone of Eclipse&#39;s plugin system as well as many recent JavaEE containers, such as GlassFish v3, WebSphere v6.1, and WebLogic Event Server. Even the SpringSource Application Platform is built on top of it.    OSGi in Action is a comprehensive guide to OSGi with two primary goals.

GWT in Action is a comprehensive tutorial for Java developers interested in building the next generation of rich, web-based applications. This book was written by Robert Hanson, creator of the popular GWT Widget Library, and Adam Tacy, a major contributor to the GWT Widget Library.    The Web is experiencing a new growth with an emphasis on rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies.    In May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit. GWT enables developers to create Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed.    GWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools. This clearly-written book is packed with hands-on GWT examples. You   ll absorb the GWT philosophy as you build your first working GWT application.    The book begins by exploring the main features of GWT, including    Compiling Java to JavaScript, the magic that really defines GWT  Building client-side components  Convenient JUnit integration and testing  Interacting with JavaScript and existing JavaScript libraries  Internationalization  You   ll also see how GWT compares to other toolkits.    GWT in Action shows you how to set up your development environment, use and create widgets, communicate with the server, and much more. Readers will follow an example running throughout the book and quickly master the basics of GWT: widgets, panels, and event handling. The book covers the full development cycle, from setting up your development environment, to building the application, then deploying it to the web server. The entire core GWT library is discussed, with details and examples on how it can be extended.    You   ll cover:    Testing, debugging, and deploying GWT Applications  Communicating with GWT-RPC  Examining client-side RPC architecture  Alternative RPC tools: HTTPRequest, RequestBuilder, and FormPanel  Achieving interoperability in GWT with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  Making your GWT application flexible and supportable  GWT helps you make the most of Ajax in your web applications and GWT in Action helps you get more out of GWT.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Robert Hanson&quot;, &quot;Adam Tacy&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Internet&quot;, &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

Some things remain the same, though. Lucene still delivers high-performance search features in a disarmingly easy-to-use API. It&#39;s still a single compact JAR file (less than 1 MB!). Due to its vibrant and diverse open-source community of developers and users, Lucene is relentlessly improving, with evolutions to APIs, significant new features such as payloads, and a huge (as much as 8x) increase in indexing speed with Lucene 3.0.    And with clear writing, reusable examples, and unmatched advice on best practices, Lucene in Action is still the definitive guide to developing with Lucene.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Erik Hatcher&quot;, &quot;Otis Gospodnetic&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Michael McCandless&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Open Source&quot; ] }</td>

With an easily scalable, pay-as-you-go model and very small startup costs, the cloud can be a great alternative to systems hosted in-house. Developers are scrambling to understand the impact a cloud-based approach will have on current and future projects.    Azure is Microsoft&#39;s full-fledged entry into the \&quot;Cloud Services Platform\&quot; arena. Unlike other cloud offerings that address only one piece of the puzzle, Azure includes an operating system, a set of developer services, and a data model that can be used individually or together. It&#39;s designed to interact seamlessly with other .NET-based components, and leverages your knowledge of Visual Studio, the .NET platform, and SQL Server. It&#39;s also fully compatible with multiple internet protocols, including HTTP, REST, SOAP, and XML.

To be \&quot;pluggable\&quot; portlets and portals must satisfy standards. The authors of this book, all but one employees of IBM, created these standards: Java Portlet Specification JSR 168 and Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP).    The book starts gently with the basics of portlet technology and a functionrich portlet example. It then dives more deeply into portlets and J2EE, portlet architecture, best practices, and explores how the popular JSF web framework can ease portlet development. It shows how to set up an open source portal and create portlets that dynamically access backend data of various types.

The book includes step-by-step instruction for building dozens of code generators of varying types. These generators build high-quality output that is consistent and maintainable. Code generation abstracts the design of the code so that multiple outputs can be created from a single model of the application functionality, which means development teams can focus on higher-level design work and strategic problems, while still meeting goals for maintaining production applications.. The book covers techniques that range from simple code processors that handle common coding problems to more elaborate and complex generators that maintain entire application tiers.  Code Generation In Action covers building database access, user interface, remote procedure, test cases, and business logic code as well as code for other key system functions.

Through a concise, but sophisticated domain specific language (DSL), you can build integration logic in lego style. The Camel DSL is implemented in a range of standard programming languages such as Java, XML, Scala, Groovy, Ruby, and Python.    Camel provides components for using these patterns via commonly used transports such as JMS, HTTP, REST, File/FTP, JPA, SMTP, and more than 50 others. No transport  Camel provides a flexible pluggable architecture to build your own components. Or you can let Camel adapt to your existing libraries without the need to change anything.    Camel in Action is for developers working with integration of any kind. This highly practical book introduces Camel and shows examples of how to use it with the 45+ supported enterprise integration patterns. Written by the people who wrote the Camel code, it&#39;s up to date and distills details and insights that only people deeply involved with Camel could provide.    Camel is designed to run in any existing environment without imposing restrictions. This allows you to get started with Camel very easily and reuse existing infrastructure and platforms. Camel can run in many forms such as standalone, web or Spring application, JBI, OSGi, Java EE, in the cloud, and so on. The book includes a technical reference explaining how to use Camel with many platforms.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Claus Ibsen&quot;, &quot;Jonathan Anstey&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

Gnuplot is the most widely used program to plot and visualize data for Unix/Linux systems and it is also popular for Windows and the Mac. It&#39;s open-source (as in free!), actively maintained, stable, and mature. It can deal with arbitrarily large data sets and is capable of producing high-quality, publication-ready graphics.    So far, the only comprehensive documentation available about gnuplot is the online reference documentation, which makes it both hard to get started and almost impossible to get a complete overview over all of its features. If you&#39;ve never tried gnuplot   or have found it tough to get your arms around   read on.    Gnuplot in Action is the first comprehensive introduction to gnuplot   from the basics to the power features and beyond. Besides providing a tutorial on gnuplot itself, it demonstrates how to apply and use gnuplot to extract intelligence from data. Particular attention is paid to tricky or poorly-explained areas. You will learn how to apply gnuplot to actual data analysis problems. This book looks at different types of graphs that can be generated with gnuplot and will discuss when and how to use them to extract actual information from data.    One of gnuplot&#39;s main advantages is that it requires no programming skills nor knowledge of advanced mathematical or statistical concepts. Gnuplot in Action assumes you have no previous knowledge of either gnuplot or statistics and data analysis. The books starts out with basic gnuplot concepts, then describes in depth how to get a graph ready for final presentation and to make it look \&quot;just right\&quot; by including arrows, labels, and other decorations.    Next the book looks at advanced concepts, such as multi-dimensional graphs and false-color plots   powerful features for special purposes. The author also describes advanced applications of gnuplot, such as how to script gnuplot so that it can run unattended as a batch job, and how to call gnuplot from within a CGI script to generate graphics for dynamic websites on demand.    Gnuplot in Action makes gnuplot easy for anyone who needs to do data analysis, but doesn&#39;t have an education in analytical tools and methods.

For administrators, PowerShell is a godsend because it provides a single, unified command line from which you can control and automate every aspect of Windows. PowerShell finally enables Windows administrators to work in a way that Unix and Linux administrators have leveraged for decades.    Like classic administrative shells, PowerShell accepts and immediately executes typed commands. In addition, it has all the features of a full-fledged programming language built in, so you can create scripts to automate even the most complex tasks. And it&#39;s fully aware of all the components of Windows and most Windows servers, so you can use PowerShell to control Exchange, IIS, SharePoint, and other core pieces of your Windows system.

It simplifies things: where standards usually discuss many possible variations of each security technique, this book focuses on the 20% of variations that are used 80% of the time. This keeps the material covered useful for all readers except the most advanced.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Ramarao Kanneganti&quot;, &quot;Prasad A.

Rather than maintaining parallel tracks, Merb 2 and Rails 3 will merge, preserving the flexible configuration and advanced features that Merb users love along with the rapid productivity and ease-of-use that makes Rails shine. As Engine Yard developer (and Manning author) Yehuda Katz puts it, \&quot;Effectively, Merb 2 is Rails 3.\&quot;    Rails 3 in Action will provide a thorough introduction to Ruby-based web development using Rails. Like Rails 3 itself, this book combines Merb and Rails in the form of authors Yehuda Katz, Merb Lead Developer.    As a developer, you&#39;ll benefit from several big advantages to this change:  Rails becomes more modular, by building on rails core with the ability to opt in or out of specific components and making it possible to replace parts of Rails without disturbing other parts.  Merb performance improvements flow into Rails, including benchmarking applications so developers can see which optimizations have real-world impact.  A defined public API with a test suite, so users and plugin developers have a stable API to build against.  A \&quot;core\&quot; version of Rails, like Merb&#39;s current core generator, that makes it easy to select just the parts that are important for your app.  DataMapper and Sequel support as first-class ORMs, along with ActiveRecord as the default.  Rack support in Rails 3, to improve the state of modular, sharable logic between applications.  The Rails 3 team is moving full steam ahead building the new version. The Merb team will start working on Rails immediately, and also continue to fix bugs and resolve other major issues in the current release of Merb. Interim versions of Merb will help ease the transition to Rails 3. In particular, Merb releases with deprecation notices and other transitional mechanisms will assist developers in tracking down the changes between Merb 1.x and Rails 3.    If you&#39;ve already learned Merb, Rails 3 in Action will help you parlay that knowledge into the new Rails code base. If you&#39;re a long time Rails developer, it will help you get up to speed with all the new Rails 3 features and changes.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Ryan Bigg&quot;, &quot;Yehuda Katz&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Internet&quot; ] }</td>

What happened  Will it regain its power and again drive economic growth as in the past     No.    That&#39;s the surprising conclusion reached by Erik Keller, a central player in the booming IT world of the 1990s. Driven by fear of being left behind, American corporations let IT grow until it reached one half of all corporate capital spending by the year 2000. Now, chastened by their spending failures, IT managers are converging on a new consensus: to exploit IT competitively they must use their smarts over big money.    This shift in thinking comes just as free, open-source software, low-cost international programming labor, and new technologies combine to make the new approach possible.    A former Research Fellow at Gartner, Keller had an insider&#39;s view of the irrational spending at many Fortune 500 companies, personally influencing billions of dollars of technology acquisitions.    In Technology Paradise Lost Keller describes how the new thinking is working inside some of the country&#39;s most complex and successful organizations, including Merrill Lynch, JetBlue, Harrah&#39;s, and Motorola which have cut IT spending to gain a competitive edge, and experienced marked gains to their bottom lines.    As it advances, the new IT think will cause further massive disruptions in the computer business, with fundamental changes in the ways software is developed, sold, and used. Efficiency of IT investment will grow as excess fat is squeezed out of IT salaries, software system costs, and consultants&#39; fees.    In an unexpected twist, Keller argues that even as IT spending is reduced its importance for competitiveness will grow. Reduced spending does not mean IT has become a commodity. Counterintuitively, companies that spend less in order to get more from information technology will likely be the big winners.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Erik Keller&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Business&quot; ] }</td>

OpenLaszlo is an increasingly popular open-source platform for the development and delivery of rich internet applications across multiple platforms: Flash, DHTML, and J2ME. The dramatic emergence of Ajax over the past year was a first step in the transition from page-oriented HTML web applications towards more full-featured rich internet applications. OpenLaszlo provides another important step in this continuing evolutionary process through the increased productivity resulting from LZX&#39;s declarative approach. It provides developers with the tools to create web-based applications offering the usability and interactivity associated with desktop applications, and the low costs associated with web-based deployment. The cross-platform nature of Laszlo LZX applications allows source code with only minimum modifications to run natively on all popular web browsers, on all desktop operating systems, on the Flash platform, and other platforms in the future.    Written to address the needs of a wide spectrum of developers, ranging from client-side HTML and JavaScript developers all the way to enterprise-class Java or Rails engineers, this book provides a very hands-on approach towards building applications that solve real-world problems across both the Flash and DHTML platforms. Starting with the fundamentals of Laszlo LZX, the authors quickly move towards applying this knowledge to the design and development of a full-scale application called the Laszlo Market. This provides a working context to assist understanding the underlying concepts of Laszlo LZX and, more importantly, how to apply this knowledge in innovative ways. The construction of the Laszlo Market proceeds over the course of the book illustrating topics starting with an initial wireframe and storyboard design to optimization issues dealing with the application&#39;s deployment across the Flash and DHTML platforms.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Norman Klein&quot;, &quot;Max Carlson with Glenn MacEwen&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Web Development&quot; ] }</td>

It starts by introducing the key differences between Java and Groovy   and how you can use them to your advantage. Then, it guides you step-by-step through realistic development challenges, from web applications to web services to desktop applications, and shows how Groovy makes them easier to put into production.    This book stays away from theory and drills down on the typical situations you face every day, like consuming and creating SOAP and RESTful web services, working with databases, and using the Spring framework. You&#39;ll also explore the great Groovy tools for build processes, testing, and deployment. Finally, you&#39;ll learn how Groovy-based domain specific languages simplify Java development.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Kenneth A.

As NHibernate is a port of Hibernate from Java to .NET, the book is based on Manning&#39;s bestselling Hibernate in Action.    NHibernate in Action begins by describing how to implement persistence in a layered .NET application. The book then quickly springs into action by introducing NHibernate through a classic \&quot;Hello World\&quot; example. It explains how to configure NHibernate to specify the mapping information between business objects and database tables, and then explores the internal architecture of NHibernate. A complete example application is progressively built with Agile methodologies in mind, which shows readers all kinds of entity and relationship mappings and how to perform CRUD operations. The book also covers advanced techniques like caching, concurrency access, and isolation levels. The Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and criteria query APIs are thoroughly detailed with optimization tips.    The last chapters of this book discuss various development scenarios, how to implement the layers of an NHibernate application (covering Windows and Web development), and which tools are available for these tasks. They also provide some solutions for data-binding objects to .NET GUI controls, integrating services, and interacting with components using DataSets. Finally, they explain how to build a complex application involving advanced session management and distributed transactions.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Pierre Henri Kuate&quot;, &quot;Tobin Harris&quot;, &quot;Christian Bauer&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gavin King&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Microsoft .NET&quot; ] }</td>

However, there are certain system-wide concerns, such as logging, security, performance, and so forth, that often need to be addressed in many, if not all of the modules. Consequently, the code to handle these system-wide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.    Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-wide concerns.    AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java. The use of Java as the base language also makes AspectJ a relatively easy language to learn.    AspectJ in Action is a practical guide to AOP and AspectJ. The reusable code examples that are provided will enable quick implementation of functionality in your system.    The book is divided into three parts. The first part introduces AOP and AspectJ and will be helpful to developers wanting to learn or advance their knowledge of AspectJ. The second and third parts present examples of everyday situations in which you can use simple and easy AspectJ solutions to implement common system requirements such as logging, policy enforcement, resource pooling, business rules, thread-safety, authentication and authorization, as well as transaction management.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Ramnivas Laddad&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

This definition naturally leads to an obvious question, \&quot;What are \&quot;maps\&quot; and why do they need to be \&quot;reduced \&quot;    Massive data sets can be extremely difficult to analyze and query using traditional mechanisms, especially when the queries themselves are quite complicated. In effect, the MapReduce algorithm breaks up both the query and the data set into constituent parts   that&#39;s the \&quot;mapping.\&quot; The mapped components of the query can be processed simultaneously   or \&quot;reduced\&quot;   to rapidly return results.

The intended readers are programmers, architects, and project managers who have to process large amounts of data offline. Hadoop in Action will lead the reader from obtaining a copy of Hadoop to setting it up in a cluster and writing data analytic programs.    The book begins by making the basic idea of Hadoop and MapReduce easier to grasp by applying the default Hadoop installation to a few easy-to-follow tasks, such as analyzing changes in word frequency across a body of documents. The book continues through the basic concepts of MapReduce applications developed using Hadoop, including a close look at framework components, use of Hadoop for a variety of data analysis tasks, and numerous examples of Hadoop in action.    Hadoop in Action will explain how to use Hadoop and present design patterns and practices of programming MapReduce. MapReduce is a complex idea both conceptually and in its implementation, and Hadoop users are challenged to learn all the knobs and levers for running Hadoop. This book takes you beyond the mechanics of running Hadoop, teaching you to write meaningful programs in a MapReduce framework.    This book assumes the reader will have a basic familiarity with Java, as most code examples will be written in Java.

This book is the first to survey this exciting new technology, its concepts, and practical applications. Considered the next step in the evolution of OOP, framework technology is at the center stage of the software strategies of Taligent, IBM, HP, Microsoft, and Apple, among others. In spite of that, frameworks remain poorly understood, and are rarely covered in the literature. This book condenses practical experience and research ideas; explains exotic terminology so that a novice computer professional can quickly absorb it; is easy to read and conceptually crisp; and will be useful to many types of readers, from programmers to technical managers.    Object-Oriented Application Frameworks:  Covers real-world commercial and public-domain frameworks:  MacApp, ET++, Taligent&#39;s Frameworks, Unidraw, InterViews (precursor of Fresco), and Prograph  Illustrates how the technology is used in applications (e.g., MFC from Microsoft) and languages (e.g., Prograph from Prograph International)  Introduces and explains the ideas in plain English&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Ted Lewis&quot;, &quot;friends&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Object-Oriented Programming&quot; ] }</td>

Tapestry represents state and behavior as standard Java objects, methods and properties. That means state management and multithreading are handled by the framework, leaving you with just your application&#39;s business logic. Tapestry does more, you do less.    Tapestry in Action is the definitive guide to the Tapestry approach: creating full-featured web apps by connecting framework components to economical amounts of application code. Many simple examples show you how to tackle common tasks such as form validation, application localization, client-side scripting, and synchronization between browser and app server. Later chapters discuss more advanced topics including creation of new components and integration with J2EE.    If you want to create great web applications using Tapestry and know Java (plus plain-vanilla HTML and a little XML), this book is for you.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Howard M.

The examples are in Java but they can be easily adapted to .NET using one of iText&#39;s .NET ports: iTextSharp or iText.NET.    This totally revised new edition introduces the new functionality added to iText in recent releases, and it updates all examples from JDK 1.4 to Java 5. You&#39;ll learn how to use traditional and new form types in PDF, including full coverage of the AcroForm technology. You&#39;ll also explore the XML Forms Architecture (XFA) and learn how to fill static and dynamic XFA forms with iText. Along the way, you&#39;ll discover new techniques for linking documents, creating a PDF based on records in a database, and much more.    WHAT&#39;S INSIDE        * Serve PDF to a browser      * Automate both static and dynamic XFA forms      * Generate dynamic PDF documents from XML files or databases      * Use PDF&#39;s many interactive features      * Add bookmarks, page numbers, watermarks, etc.      * Split, concatenate, and manipulate PDF pages      * Add digital signatures to a PDF file      * New hands-on, ready to use examples&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Bruno Lowagie&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

With Subversion&#39;s control components you can simplify and streamline the management of your code way beyond what&#39;s possible with CVS. For example, with just one powerful feature, Subversion&#39;s atomic commit, you can easily track and roll back a set of changes.    Subversion in Action introduces you to Subversion and the concepts of version control. Using production-quality examples it teaches you how Subversion features can be customized and combined to effectively deal with your day-to-day source control problems. You&#39;ll learn how to do practical things you cannot do with CVS, like seamlessly renaming and moving files.    The book covers branching and repository control, access control, and much more.

This book explores what can be done with LINQ, shows you how it works in an application, and addresses the emerging best practices. It presents the general purpose query facilities offered by LINQ in the upcoming C# 3.0 and VB.NET 9.0 languages. A running example introduces basic LINQ concepts. You   ll then learn to query unstructured data using LINQ to XML and relational data with LINQ to SQL. Finally, you   ll see how to extend LINQ for custom applications.    LINQ in Action will guide you along as you navigate this new world of lambda expressions, query operators, and expression trees. You   ll also explore the new features of C# 3.0, VB.NET 9.0. The book is very practical, anchoring each new idea with running code.    You will discover all the basics needed to get a clear understanding of LINQ. Whether you want to use LINQ to query objects, XML documents, or relational databases, you will find all the information you need to get started.    But LINQ in Action does not stop at the basic code. This book also shows you how LINQ can be used for advanced processing of data. This includes coverage of LINQ   s extensibility, which allows querying more data sources than those supported by default.    All code samples are built on a concrete business case.

New technologies and devices   not to mention higher user expectations   have greatly multiplied the complexity level of interface programming. Enter JavaFX.    JavaFX is a set of Java-based rich user interface technologies that sits atop the existing Java Standard and Micro Editions, making current Java packages readily accessible from the JavaFX environment. At its heart is JavaFX Script, an innovative, compiled, domain specific language. JavaFX Script boasts a declarative syntax where the code structure mirrors the structure of the interface. Related UI pieces are kept in one efficient bundle, not strewn across multiple locations. A simple coding model reduces code complexity while increasing productivity. The JavaFX-specific libraries for presentation and animation take advantage of JavaFX Script&#39;s unique language features.    JavaFX in Action is a hands-on tutorial that introduces and explores JavaFX through numerous bite-sized projects. The book provides a solid grounding in the JavaFX syntax and related APIs by showing you how to apply the key features of the JavaFX platform. You&#39;ll absorb the fundamentals of the technology while exploring the possibilities JavaFX open up for your designs.    Author Simon Morris helps you transform variables and operators into bouncing raindrops, brilliant colors, and dancing interface components. Below the chrome, you&#39;ll master techniques to make your applications more responsive and user friendly. You&#39;ll also learn how to interact with your existing Java code so you can give your old apps some new JavaFX sparkle.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Simon Morris&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

ASP.NET MVC is a development framework designed around these principles. It provides the structure you need to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, in which an application is divided into three distinct parts:        * Models, the objects that contain an application&#39;s logic      * Views, the components that create the user interface of an application      * Controllers, the components that handle and respond to user input    Applications built with ASP.NET MVC are easier to test, maintain, and extend because the architecture and role of each component is well-defined. And since it&#39;s built from the ground up as a core part of the .NET framework, it integrates seamlessly with the ASP.NET features, such as Web Forms or Master Pages, that you already use.

From him you will gain a deep understanding of the language and how best to use it, and you&#39;ll love his insights into why PowerShell works the way it does.    This book is a tutorial for sysadmins and developers introducing the PowerShell language and its environment. It shows you how to build scripts and utilities to automate system tasks or create powerful system management tools to handle the day-to-day tasks that drive a Windows administrator&#39;s life. It&#39;s rich in interesting examples that will spark your imagination.

The book builds its code examples incrementally, introducing new concepts as it goes. It covers Hibernate&#39;s many, useful configuration and design options, breaking a complex subject into digestible pieces.

Because they are often large and complex, GUI programming toolkits can be hard to use. wxPython is a combination of the Python programming language and the wxWidgets toolkit, which allows programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and easily. wxPython combines the power of an exceptionally complete user interface toolkit with an exceptionally flexible programming language. The result is a toolkit that is unique in the ease with which complex applications can be built and maintained.    wxPython in Action is a complete guide to the wxPython toolkit, containing a tutorial for getting started, a guide to best practices, and a reference to wxPython s extensive widget set. After an easy introduction to wxPython concepts and programming practices, the book takes an in-depth tour of when and how to use the bountiful collection of widgets offered by wxPython. All features are illustrated with useful code examples and reference tables are included for handy lookup of an object s properties, methods, and events. The book enables developers to learn wxPython quickly and remains a valuable resource for future work.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Noel Rappin&quot;, &quot;Robin Dunn&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Python&quot; ] }</td>

Like Haskell and Scala, Clojure supports the functional style of programming. By combining first-class functions, lexical closures, multimethods, and a full-fledged macro system, you get more than what typical OO languages can possibly offer. Moreover, you get ultra-clean code that reflects Lisp&#39;s famously-concise style. That means far fewer bugs when compared to stateful languages such as Java or C++.    Clojure in Action is a hands-on tutorial for the working programmer who has written code in a language like Java or Ruby, but has no prior experience with Lisp.

Blow through the theory and dive into practical matters like unit-testing, environment set up, all the way through building a scalable web-application using domain-specific languages, Hadoop, HBase, and RabbitMQ.    For readers coming from Java, you&#39;ll see how Clojure&#39;s use of the JVM makes it seamlessly interoperable with existing Java code. Learn how to access the thousands of existing libraries and frameworks. You&#39;ll also discover the concurrency semantics built into the language, which enable you to very easily write multi-threaded programs and take advantage of multiple cores in modern CPUs. With cloud-computing and multi-core becoming major trends, this is a huge advantage.

OOram has been fine-tuned over a decade on hundreds of projects by Trygve Reenskaug and his collaborators. It is supported by available CASE tools, training, and consulting.    Working With Objects is the source on a method which takes an evolutionary step forward in object-oriented development practices. OOram adds the intuitively simple but powerful concept of a role to object-oriented models and methods. For example, imagine trying to describe a person as an object. The most effective way to do this would be to independently describe each of the roles that person adopts (parent, employee, and so on) and then define how the person supports them. These ideas form the heart of the OOram approach.    In a presentation rich with examples, Working With Objects is anything but the typical, dry methodology book. It tells real-life stories. It teaches how to apply role modeling and benefit from its inherent advantages, including:    Multiple views of the same model  Support for both data- and process-centered approaches  Large systems described through a number of distinct models  Derivation of composite models from simpler, base models  Decentralized management of very large systems  Programming language-independent design  Step-by-step transformation of models into implementations  Integration of powerful reuse techniques with work policies, processes and organization&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Trygve Reenskaug&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Object-Oriented Programming&quot; ] }</td>

Ryan Doherty, Web Development Engineer, Mozilla&quot;, &quot;longDescription&quot; : &quot;JavaScript developers commonly rely on collections of reusable JavaScript code--written by themselves or by someone else at their company. Alternatively, they rely on code from a third party. But in all these cases they need to know how to either construct a cross-browser library from scratch or be adept at using and maintaining their library of choice.    In Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja, JavaScript expert John Resig reveals the inside know-how of the elite JavaScript programmers. Written to be accessible to JavaScript developers with intermediate-level skills, this book will give you the knowledge you need to create a cross-browser JavaScript library from the ground up.    This book takes you on a journey towards mastering modern JavaScript development in three phases: design, construction, and maintenance. You first are given a base of strong, advanced JavaScript knowledge, enabling you to make decisions about the overall design of a library and how to tackle its eventual construction. The book then teaches you how to construct your library. It examines all the numerous tasks JavaScript libraries have to tackle and provides practical solutions and development strategies for their creation. It then guides you through the various maintenance techniques you will need to keep your code running well into the future.    With Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja you will have all the knowledge and skills available to build your own JavaScript library, or to understand how to use any modern JavaScript library available.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;John Resig&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

With these in place, applications to cryptography are introduced. The book is filled with C code to illustrate how mathematics is put into a computer, and the last several chapters show how to implement several cryptographic protocols. The most important is a description of P1363, an IEEE draft standard for public key cryptography.    The main purpose of Implementing Elliptic Curve Cryptography is to help \&quot;crypto engineers\&quot; implement functioning, state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms in the minimum time. With detailed descriptions of the mathematics, the reader can expand on the code given in the book and develop optimal hardware or software for their own applications.    Implementing Elliptic Curve Cryptography assumes the reader has at least a high school background in algebra, but it explains, in stepwise fashion, what has been considered to be a topic only for graduate-level students. &quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Michael Rosing&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Theory&quot; ] }</td>

While it&#39;s easy to grasp the theory of SOA, implementing well-designed, practical SOA systems can be a difficult challenge. Developers and enterprise architects still face the following issues:        * How to get high-availability with SOA      * How to know a service has failed      * How to create reports when data is scattered within multiple services      * How to increase the loose coupling of your SOA      * How to solve authentication and authorization for service consumers--internal and external      * How to integrate SOA and the UI      * How to avoid common SOA pitfalls      * How to choose technologies that increase the performance of your services    In SOA Patterns, author Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz provides detailed, technology-neutral solutions to these challenges, and many others. This book provides architectural guidance through patterns and anti-patterns. It shows you how to build real SOA services that feature flexibility, availability, and scalability. Through an extensive set of patterns, this book identifies the major SOA pressure points and provides reusable techniques to address them. Each pattern pairs the classic Problem/Solution format with a unique technology map, showing where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.    SOA Patterns shows you how to address common SOA concerns, including the areas of performance, availability, scalability, security, management, service interaction, user interface interaction, and service aggregation. The SOA anti-patterns part shows you how to avoid common mistakes and how to refactor broken systems. The book also maps quality attributes to patterns so that you can easily find the patterns relevant to your problems.    WHAT&#39;S INSIDE:        * Details more than 30 patterns for common SOA scenarios in the areas of security, performace, availability, UI integration, service aggregation and service interaction      * Describes more than 20 SOA pitfalls to avoid      * Spotlights the architecural perspective on SOA      * Explains technology mapping from conceptual solution to current technologies      * Provides extensive and practical advice on matching patterns to technologies  &quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;SOA&quot; ] }</td>

The reader will become acquainted with the world of custom JSP tags--new JSP technology that is beginning to have an enormous impact on the way people are developing JSP.    JSP tags are Java components that can be used from within a JSP file. By representing these components as tags, code authors can open up their JSP development to the everyday content developer as well as improve their code reuse and separation between presentation and business logic.    The book is fully loaded with many real-world tags including tags to perform iterations, access databases, EJBs, email systems and JavaBeans. To make the tag usage even more real, the book also offers two full-scale case studies in which the reader will see how tags can be used in the context of:    e-Commerce applications  WAP applications that work with current cellular phones  This book covers all aspects of JSP Tag development for Scriptlet-free generation of online content. It focuses on reusable component-centric design via JavaBeans and custom tags to separate presentation from implementation.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Gal Shachor&quot;, &quot;Adam Chace&quot;, &quot;Magnus Rydin&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Internet&quot; ] }</td>

Its much-improved replacement, C++/CLI, now provides an effective bridge between the native and managed programming worlds. Using this technology, developers can combine existing C++ programs and .NET applications with little or no refactoring. Accessing .NET libraries like Windows Forms, WPF, and WCF from standard C++ is equally easy.    C++/CLI in Action is a practical guide that will help you breathe new life into your legacy C++ programs. The book begins with a concise C++/CLI tutorial. It then quickly moves to the key themes of native/managed code interop and mixed-mode programming. You   ll learn to take advantage of GUI frameworks like Windows Forms and WPF while keeping your native C++ business logic. The book also covers methods for accessing C# or VB.NET components and libraries.

Eric Siber, Developpez.com&quot;, &quot;longDescription&quot; : &quot;Agile principles have been a breath of fresh air to many development teams stuck in the middle of a rigid, process-driven environment. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not so easy to bring Agile into an existing organization with established people and practices. Becoming Agile shows you practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process to an Agile process without starting from scratch.    Many books discuss Agile from a theoretical or academic perspective. Becoming Agile takes a different approach and focuses on explaining Agile from a ground-level point-of-view. Author Greg Smith, a certified ScrumMaster with dozens of Agile projects under his belt, presents Agile principles in the context of a case study that flows throughout the book.    Becoming Agile focuses on the importance of adapting Agile principles to the realities of your environment. While Agile purists have often discouraged a    partial-Agile    approach, the reality is that in many shops a    purist    approach simply isn&#39;t a viable option. Over the last few years, Agile authorities have begun to discover that the best deployments of Agile are often customized to the specific situation of a given company.  As well, Becoming Agile addresses the cultural realities of deploying Agile and how to deal with the needs of executives, managers, and the development team during migration. The author discusses employee motivation and establishing incentives that reward support of Agile techniques.    Becoming Agile will show you how to create a custom Agile process that supports the realities of your environment. The process will minimize risk as you transition to Agile iteratively, allowing time for your culture and processes to acclimate to Agile principles.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Greg Smith&quot;, &quot;Ahmed Sidky&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Software Engineering&quot; ] }</td>

For Java developers, the Java Message Service (JMS) provides that core functionality. The Apache ActiveMQ message broker is a complete open source implementation of the JMS specification. The ActiveMQ Message-Oriented Middleware, coupled with its Enterprise Integration Provider are the building blocks of an Enterprise Service Bus   the backbone of a contemporary Service Oriented Architecture.    ActiveMQ is implemented in Java, but it supports client applications written in many other programming languages including C/C++, .NET, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Python, and more. It can be integrated with other open source frameworks including Tomcat, ServiceMix, JBoss, and can easily bridge to other JMS providers.    Apache ActiveMQ in Action is a thorough, practical guide to implementing message-oriented systems in Java using ActiveMQ. The book lays out the core of ActiveMQ in clear language, starting with the anatomy of a JMS message and moving quickly through connectors, message persistence, authentication and authorization. With the basics well in hand, you move into interesting examples of ActiveMQ at work, following a running Stock Portfolio application. You&#39;ll integrate ActiveMQ with containers like Geronimo and JBoss and learn to tie into popular Java-based technologies like Spring Framework.    Along the way, you&#39;ll pick up best practices forged out of the deep experience the authors bring to the book. You&#39;ll learn to integrate with non-Java technologies and explore advanced topics like broker topologies and configuration and performance tuning.    Additionally, the book will introduce readers to using Apache Camel with Apache ActiveMQ as a way to easily utilize the Enterprise Integration Patterns.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Bruce Snyder&quot;, &quot;Dejan Bosanac&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Rob Davies&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Java&quot; ] }</td>

Its unique blend of a complete, lightweight container that allows you to build a complex application from loosely-coupled POJOs and a set of easily understood abstractions that simplify construction, testing, and deployment make Spring both powerful and easy-to-use   a hard-to-beat combination. With this power comes the potential for a wide range of uses in both common and not-so-common scenarios. That&#39;s where Spring in Practice comes in.    Unlike the many books that teach you what Spring is, Spring in Practice shows you how to tackle the challenges you face when you build Spring-based applications. The book empowers software developers to solve concrete business problems \&quot;the Spring way\&quot; by mapping application-level issues to Spring-centric solutions.    Spring in Practice diverges from other cookbooks because it presents the background you need to understand the domain in which a solution applies before it offers the specific steps to solve the problem. You&#39;re never left with the feeling that you understand the answer, but find the question irrelevant. You can put the book to immediate use even if you don&#39;t have deep knowledge of every part of Spring Framework.    The book divides into three main parts. In Part 1, you&#39;ll get a rapid overview of Spring Framework   enough to get you started if you&#39;re new and a great refresher for readers who already have a few Spring cycles. Part 2 provides techniques that are likely to be useful no matter what type of application you&#39;re building. You&#39;ll find discussions of topics like user accounts, security, site navigation, and application diagnosis.    Part 3 provides domain-specific recipes. Here, you&#39;ll find practical solutions to realistic and interesting business problems. For example, this part discusses Spring-based approaches for ecommerce, lead generation, and CRM.    There are several recurring themes throughout Spring in Practice, including Spring MVC, Hibernate, and transactions. Each recipe is an opportunity to highlight something new or interesting about Spring, and to focus on that concept in detail.    This book assumes you have a good foundation in Java and Java EE.

Multiple processors with multiple cores running multiple threads is quickly becoming the norm. C++ developers will have to master the principles, techniques, and new language features supporting concurrency to stay ahead of the curve.    With the new C++ Standard and Technical Report 2 (TR2), multi-threading is coming to C++ in a big way. There is a new memory model with support for multiple threads, along with a new multi-threading support library featuring low-level atomic operations, as well as basic thread launching and synchronization facilities. TR2 will provide higher-level synchronization facilities that allow for a much greater level of abstraction, and make programming multi-threaded applications simpler and safer.    C++ Concurrency in Action is the first book to show you how to take advantage of the new C++ Standard and TR2 to write robust multi-threaded applications in C++.    As a guide and reference to the new concurrency features in the upcoming C++ Standard and TR, this book is invaluable for existing programmers familiar with writing multi-threaded code in C++ using platform-specific APIs, or in other languages, as well as C++ programmers who have never written multi-threaded code before.    If you&#39;re a programmer accustomed to writing single-threaded applications, C++ Concurrency in Action will show you how to write your new parallel algorithm in C++. You&#39;ll learn to avoid many of the pitfalls associated with writing multi-threaded applications. You can also use this book to quickly transfer your platform-specific knowledge to the new Standard C++ threading library, enabling you to use a single API on both systems and simplify your code.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Anthony Williams&quot; ], &quot;categories&quot; : [ &quot;Microsoft .NET&quot; ] }</td>

A new species is evolving to take their place, one which is lean, fast, portable, and easy to maintain: Java servlets.    Servlets are not merely an alternative to CGI, for they can do much more. Servlets have opened the door to a world of client/server applications that would have been too difficult or too time-consuming to consider before.    Java Servlets: By Example takes the reader into the world of servlets, moving example by example from the simple to the complex. An early chapter explains the simple HTML form processing through servlets. A later chapter shows how to connect a Java applet to a servlet, which is itself connected to a database.    Java Servlets: By Example is full of real-world, ready-to-run example code. Each chapter deals with a new problem and takes the reader through a series of servlet-based solutions.

Then you&#39;ll dive into asynchronous programming, a model Node leverages to lessen application bottlenecks.&quot;, &quot;longDescription&quot; : &quot;JavaScript on the server? Yep. Node.js is an elegant server-side JavaScript development environment perfect for scalable, high-performance web applications. With Node you access HTTP and TCP/IP functionality through a minimalist server-side Javascript interface. It supports an asynchronous programming model that enables the web server to more easily do more than one thing at a time, a key requirement for real-time applications such as chat, online games, and live statistics. And since it&#39;s JavaScript, you&#39;ll use the same language throughout your entire application.\n\nNode.js in Action is an example-driven tutorial that starts at square one and guides you through all the features, techniques, and concepts you&#39;ll need to build production-quality Node applications. You&#39;ll start by learning how to set up your Node development environment, including loading the community-created extensions. Next, you&#39;ll run several simple demonstration programs where you&#39;ll learn the basics of a few common types of Node applications. Then you&#39;ll dive into asynchronous programming, a model Node leverages to lessen application bottlenecks.\n\nWith the basics under your belt, you&#39;re ready to start building serious web applications using Node&#39;s HTTP API. You&#39;ll explore data storage, application deployment, and output templating, and you&#39;ll discover community frameworks that make web development easier and faster. Along the way, you&#39;ll learn to interact with the filesystem and to create non-HTTP applications, such as TCP/IP servers and command-line tools.\n\nMuch of the Node ecosystem is open source, so this book will show you how the community works and how you can contribute. You&#39;ll learn about the NPM Repository, where most community extensions reside, and you&#39;ll learn how to publish your own extensions. In addition, the book outlines online resources for getting help with any stumbling blocks you run into during your journey as a Node developer.\nWHAT&#39;S INSIDE&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [ &quot;Mike Cantelon&quot;, &quot;Marc Harter&quot;, &quot;T.J.

This book has two main goals: to familiarize the reader with the portions of XSLT that he/she will use eighty per cent of the time, and to provide a \&quot;cookbook\&quot; approach to learning additional techniques as they are needed.    Part One is a step-by-step tutorial that brings the reader up to speed on the basic concepts and document manipulation techniques necessary for the most common XSLT tasks. More importantly, it represents the foundation on which the understanding of everything in Part Two is built.    Part Two is a cookbook--a task-oriented user&#39;s guide to various issues one may meet in tackling XSLT. This portion of the book is organized by the goals of XSLT tasks (converting elements to attributes, reading in multiple documents at once, etc.). This makes it far easier for readers who don&#39;t already know XSLT to quickly find the solutions to their stylesheet development problems.    XSLT Quickly also includes a glossary, a quick reference section for XSLT syntax, and a quick reference for using the popular XSLT processors.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [], &quot;categories&quot; : [] }</td>

Throughout the book, you&#39;ll follow a comprehensive use case that expert authors Opher Etzion and Peter Niblett construct step-by-step.    Complex Event Processing, or CEP, is an emerging discipline, as well as an emerging market, which in 2008 is estimated in  150M and is expected to cross the  1B mark in 2-3 years. According to analysts&#39; surveys, many businesses are starting to investigate both technical and business value considerations of implementing event processing into their organizations.    Event Processing in Action will answer key questions like:        * What are event driven architectures and how do they fit enterprise applications       * What are the various uses of event processing       * What are its major concepts       * What is the life-cycle of event driven application, and how should building such an application be approached     As the story unfolds through the construction of an event-driven application, readers will see how a specification in a graphical notation grows into a working example. Programming examples will be based on a set of building blocks developed in the book; existing commercial products and open source alternatives will be surveyed.    This book is intended for software architects and developers who want to understand the principles behind the emerging discipline of event processing, and go deeper to the details.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [], &quot;categories&quot; : [] }</td>

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Microsoft&#39;s new user interface framework, gives you the ability to create stunning graphics, rich interactions, and highly-usable Windows applications. WPF is the API beneath Windows Vista interfaces, and it&#39;s also available for older versions of Windows. Up to this point, it has only been possible to build WPF applications manually, mainly by hand-coding in XAML   WPF&#39;s declarative XML-based markup language. The soon-to-be-released Visual Studio 2008 provides the full set of developer tools you need to take advantage of this exciting technology.    The combination of WPF and Visual Studio 2008 represents the start of the next generation of Windows applications. Hand-coding XAML is fine if you&#39;re an early adopter, but to put WPF into production, you need to master the tools and application styles you&#39;ll use in your day job.    WPF in Action with Visual Studio 2008 focuses on WPF development using Visual Studio 2008 and other available tools. The book starts with thorough coverage of the basics, layouts, styles, resources, and themes. It then takes you through several real-world scenarios, exploring common challenges and application-types. You&#39;ll build several sample applications, ranging from a simple calculator to a typical line-of-business application. Along the way, you&#39;ll add graphical elements, animation, and support for printing, accessibility, and other standard functionality.    Written in a witty, engaging style, WPF in Action with Visual Studio 2008 can be read cover-to-cover or used to reference specific problems and issues. The approach is practical and always focused on how you&#39;ll use WPF in real development scenarios. You&#39;ll learn how to handle the many new issues presented by the extreme flexibility of WPF. The authors also provide numerous tips and suggestions for how to work efficiently.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [], &quot;categories&quot; : [] }</td>

Dynamic WAP Application Development first introduces the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and offers an in-depth explanation of the prominent wireless languages.    The authors begin with HDML (Handheld Device Markup Language), the first wireless language and one still supported by many Internet-enabled phones in the United States. They next cover WML (Wireless Markup Language), the XML-based successor to HDML that is supported by most phones worldwide. The third language described is WMLScript, the client-side scripting language of the wireless world that enables the developer to include procedure logic within their WML markup. In addition to hands-on practice with each of these languages, the book examines the issues involved in wireless application design and in converting HDML documents into WML.    The book also provides an overview of Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) and Java Servlets, and guides developers through the process of creating dynamic WAP applications using these server-side technologies.    Application design specific to the small display and limited memory capacity of wireless phones is also covered. Advanced topics include security, performance, and the intricacies of WAP gateways. The book also includes robust case studies that put WAP concepts into practice.    This book is geared for developers who are called upon to extend existing Web services to wireless phone subscribers and for those who need to understand the resources involved in the development and deployment of WAP applications.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [], &quot;categories&quot; : [] }</td>

The starting point for this project was a .NET implementation of Python, dubbed IronPython. After a couple years of incubation, IronPython is ready for real-world use. It blends the simplicity, elegance, and dynamism of Python with the power of the .NET framework.    IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft&#39;s exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You&#39;ll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you&#39;ll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming.    IronPython opens up exciting new possibilities. Because it&#39;s a dynamic language, it permits programming paradigms not easily available in VB and C#. In this book, authors Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead explore the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and    duck typing   , metaprogramming, and more.    IronPython in Action explores these topics with examples, making use of the Python interactive console to explore the .NET framework with live objects. The expert authors provide a complete introduction for programmers to both the Python language and the power of the .NET framework. The book also shows how to extend IronPython with C#, extending C# and VB.NET applications with Python, using IronPython with .NET 3.0 and Powershell, IronPython as a Windows scripting tool, and much more.    Whether you&#39;re a Python user exploring .NET or a .NET developer exploring the world of dynamic languages, IronPython in Action will get you started quickly and show you how to be productive with this powerful new tool.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [], &quot;categories&quot; : [] }</td>

Beginning with coverage of the history of the architecture of web applications, highlighting the uses of the standard web API to create applications with increasingly sophisticated architectures, developers are led through a discussion on the development of industry accepted best practices for architecture.    Described is the history and evolution towards this architecture and the reasons that it is superior to previous efforts. Also provided is an overview of the most popular web application frameworks, covering their architecture and use. Numerous frameworks exist, but trying to evaluate them is difficult because their documentation stresses their advantages but hides their deficiencies. Here, the same application is built in six different frameworks, providing a way to perform an informed comparison. Also provided is an evaluation of the pros and cons of each framework to assist in making a decision or evaluating a framework on your own. Finally, best practices are covered, including sophisticated user interface techniques, intelligent caching and resource management, performance tuning, debugging, testing, and Web services.&quot;, &quot;status&quot; : &quot;PUBLISH&quot;, &quot;authors&quot; : [], &quot;categories&quot; : [] }</td>

That&#39;s the idea behind rule-based programming. A rule engine automatically decides how to apply the rules to your facts and hands you the result. This approach is ideal for expressing business rules and is increasingly used in enterprise computing.    Jess is a popular rule engine written in Java. It&#39;s supported by Sandia Labs and has an active online community. If you have a problem that can be solved with rules, Jess in Action will show you how. (If you are not sure, read chapter 2.) Written by the creator of Jess, this book is an accessible and practical guide to rule-based system development in Java.    Jess in Action first introduces rule programming concepts and teaches you the Jess language. Armed with this knowledge, you then progress through a series of fully-developed applications chosen to expose you to practical rule-based development.

Success   and sanity   dictate that developers and designers work at higher levels of abstraction so that they can remain focused on the problems they&#39;re trying to solve. Domain Specific Languages, \&quot;little languages\&quot; implemented on top of a conventional programming language, provide a way to maintain the power of the underlying network of technology while writing code that more closely models the domain of the business problem.    DSLs in Action introduces the concepts and definitions a developer needs to build high-quality domain specific languages. It provides a solid foundation to the usage as well as implementation aspects of a DSL, focusing on the necessity of applications speaking the language of the domain. After reading this book, a programmer will be able to design APIs that make better domain models. For experienced developers, the book addresses the intricacies of domain language design without the pain of writing parsers by hand.    The gap in understanding between the development team and the business domain specialists can lead to errors during user acceptance tests. This book teaches developers to build DSLs that bridge this gap by offering API development techniques that closely model the domain vocabulary. Even non-programmer domain experts can benefit from this book by learning how DSLs can make them a more integral part of the team during the program development phase.    The book discusses DSL usage and implementations in the real world based on a suite of JVM languages like Java, Ruby, Scala, and Groovy. It contains code snippets that implement real world DSL designs and discusses the pros and cons of each implementation.
